    <h1>Welcome to Recommendo!</h1>
    <p>So this is really an excuse for me to get comfortable with vuejs and always a place I can capture recommendations from friends and family</p>
    <p>Lots of work to do to get this app fully functional, but we have something working now</p>
    <ul>
      <li>running every for free which gives some limitations</li>
      <li>when you add a recommendation it goes to a backend that will update it later, you will see the recommendation for you but others will need to wait a bit, this will be changed in the future</li>
      <li>Can only proccess 100 recommendation a month :(, when we hit the limit I'll add a notification</li>
    </ul>
    <p>everything is open souce, you can see the code, add issues and contribute <a href="https://github.com/Ryan-Coates/Recommendo">here</a></p>
